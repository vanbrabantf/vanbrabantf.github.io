I firmly believe that the key to building great software is to look further than technology or processes; it's the communication with and alignment between all stakeholders that makes the difference.

As an architect, I want to work towards a best-fit and sustainable solution that balances people, processes and technology.

I love public speaking as well. My keynote talks and lectures focus on technical architecture and managing software teams.
